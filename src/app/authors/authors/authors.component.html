              <p><strong>Manuscript Preparation:</strong></p>
              
              <p>Please follow the instructions reported in this page before submission.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Language</strong></p>
              
              <p>The text should be written in English.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Manuscript format</strong></p>
              
              <p>The whole manuscript should be prepared as a single file, including the final version of the manuscript, comprehensive of tables, figure captions and figures, in this order. It is strongly recommended to upload figures as high-resolution, separate files during the submission process. Cite references, figures, and tables in numerical order. Use SI units of measure. Generic names of drugs and pesticides are preferred; if trade names are used, the generic name should be given at first mention. Assemble the manuscript in this order: Title Page, Abstract, Text, Acknowledgments, References, Figure Legends, Tables, and Figures.&nbsp;<strong>No particular fonts or page setting is required&nbsp;</strong>at this stage.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Title page</strong></p>
              
              <p>The title page should contain these elements: Full title, First author: surname and initial(s) and short title. All authors: full names and affiliations; name and complete address for the corresponding author&nbsp;(including e-mail address, fax number and telephone number).</p>
              
              <p><strong>Abstract and Keywords</strong></p>
              
              <p>Manuscripts should have a structured abstract of no more than 400 words, presenting essential data in divided paragraphs introduced by separate headings in the following order: Objectives, Background, Methods, Results, and Conclusions. Use complete sentences. All data in the abstract must also appear in the manuscript text or tables. Insert five to seven keywords after the abstract. Do not cite references in the abstract, and limit the use of acronyms and abbreviations. Define acronyms or abbreviation in parenthesis at first use.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Text</strong></p>
              <p>Submit your text in either .doc or .docx format. Please embed figures or tables in the Text document and submit the supplementary material as separate files.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              
              <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
              
              <p>This section should be succinct, with no subheadings.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Materials and Methods</strong></p>
              
              <p>The methods section should provide enough detail for others to be able to replicate the study. If you have more than one method, use subsections with relevant headings, e.g. different models, in vitro and in vivo studies, statistics, materials and reagents, etc.</p>
              
              <p>JCI has no space restriction on methods. Detailed descriptions of the methods (including protocols or project descriptions) and algorithms may also be uploaded as supplementary information or a previous publication that gives more details may be cited. If the method from a previous article is used then this article must be cited and discussed. If wording is reused from a published article then this must be noted, e.g. this study uses the method of Efrid et al. and the methods description partly reproduces their wording [1].</p>
              
              <p>If a method or tool is introduced in the study, including software, questionnaires, and scales, the license this is available under and any requirement for permission for use should be stated. If an existing method or tool is used in the research, the authors are responsible for checking the license and obtaining any necessary permission. If permission was required, a statement confirming permission was granted should be included in the Materials and Methods section.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Results and Discussion</strong></p>
              <p>This section may be divided into subsections or may be combined.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Main Text (Review only)</strong></p>
              <p>This section may be divided into subsections or may be combined.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
              <p>This should clearly explain the main conclusions of the article, highlighting its importance and relevance.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Data Availability</strong></p>
              <p>This statement should describe how readers can access the data supporting the conclusions of the study and clearly outline the reasons why unavailable data cannot be released.</p>
              <p><strong>Compliance with Ethical Standards</strong></p>
              <p>To ensure objectivity and transparency in research and to ensure that accepted principles of ethical and professional conduct have been followed, authors should include information regarding sources of funding, potential conflicts of interest (financial or non-financial), informed consent if the research involved human participants, and a statement on welfare of animals if the research involved animals.</p>
              <p>Authors should include the following statements (if applicable) in a separate section entitled &ldquo;Compliance with Ethical Standards&rdquo; when submitting a paper:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest</li>
              <li>Research involving Human Participants and/or Animals</li>
              <li>Informed consent</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Please note that standards could vary slightly per journal dependent on their peer review policies (i.e. single or double blind peer review) as well as per journal subject discipline. Before submitting your article check the instructions following this section carefully.</p>
              <p>The corresponding author should be prepared to collect documentation of compliance with ethical standards and send if requested during peer review or after publication.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Acknowledgments, Sources of Funding, and Disclosures:</strong></p>
              
              <p>The corresponding author will include a summary statement in the text of the manuscript in a separate section before the reference list that reflects what is recorded in the potential conflict of interest disclosure form.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Acknowledgments:</strong>&nbsp;The acknowledgments section lists each individual&rsquo;s substantive contributions. Authors should obtain written, signed permission from all individuals listed in the &lsquo;Acknowledgments&rsquo; section of the manuscript, because readers may infer their endorsement of data and conclusions. These permissions must be provided to the Editorial Office.</p>
              <p><strong>Sources of Funding:</strong>&nbsp;Authors must list all sources of research support relevant to the manuscript. All grant funding agency abbreviations or acronyms should be completely spelled out.</p>
              <p><strong>Conflict of Interest:</strong>&nbsp;Authors must state any disclosures in the cover letter when submitting a manuscript. If there is no conflict of interest, please state &ldquo;Conflict of Interest: None to report.&rdquo; Conflicts of interest pertain to relationships with pharmaceutical companies, biomedical device manufacturers or other corporations whose products or services are related to the subject matter of the article. Such relationships include, but are not limited to, employment by an industrial concern, ownership of stock, membership on a standing advisory council or committee, membership of a board of directors, or a public association with the company or its products. Other areas of real or perceived conflict of interest could include receiving honoraria or consulting fees or receiving grants or funds from such corporations or individuals representing such corporations. The corresponding author should collect Conflict of Interest information from all co-authors before submitting a manuscript.</p>
              <p>See below examples of disclosures:</p>
              <p><strong>Funding:</strong>&nbsp;This study was funded by X (grant number X).</p>
              <p><strong>Conflict of Interest:</strong>&nbsp;Author A has received research grants from Company A. Author B has received a speaker honorarium from Company X and owns stock in Company Y. Author C is a member of committee Z.</p>
              <p>If no conflict exists, the authors should state:</p>
              <p>Conflict of Interest: The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.</p>
              
              <p><strong>References</strong></p>
              <p>Authors may submit their references in any style. If accepted, these will be reformatted in the according to the journal style. Authors are responsible for ensuring that the information in each reference is complete and accurate. All references should be numbered consecutively in the order of their first citation. Citations of references in the text should be identified using numbers in square brackets e.g., &ldquo;as discussed by Efrid [9]&rdquo;; &ldquo;as discussed elsewhere [9,10]&rdquo;. All references should be cited within the text and uncited references will be removed.</p>

              <p><strong>Tables and Figures:</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Each table should be numbered and cited in sequence using Arabic numerals (i.e., Table 1, 2, 3, etc.).</li>
              <li>Titles for tables should appear above the table and be no longer than 15 words. They should be pasted at the end of the document text file, in A4 Portrait or Landscape format. These will be typeset and displayed as such in the final, published form of the article.</li>
              <li>Tables should be formatted using the &lsquo;Table object&rsquo; in a word processing program to ensure that columns of data remain aligned when the file is sent electronically for review.</li>
              <li>Tables should not be embedded as figures or spreadsheet files. Larger datasets or tables too wide for a Landscape page can be uploaded separately, as additional files.</li>
              <li>Additional files will not be displayed in the final, laid-out PDF of the article, but a link will be provided to the files as supplied by the author.</li>
              <li>Figures should be provided in a separate single .DOC, .PDF or .PPT file, with a resolution of at least 300 dpi and not be embedded in the main manuscript file. If a figure consists of separate parts, please submit a single, composite illustration page that includes all parts of the figure. There are no charges for the use of color figures.</li>
              <li>The figure legends should be included in the main manuscript text file at the end of the document, rather than as part of the figure file.</li>
              <li>For each figure, Figure numbers should be provided in sequence, using Arabic numerals, a title of 15 words maximum and a detailed legend of up to 300 words. Please note that it is the responsibility of the author(s) to obtain permission from the copyright holder(s) to reproduce figures or tables that have previously been published elsewhere.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p><strong>Supplementary materials</strong></p>
              <p>Supplementary materials are the additional parts to a manuscript, such as audio files, video clips, or datasets that might be of interest to readers. Authors can submit one file of supplementary material along with their manuscript through the Manuscript Tracking System. If there is more than one file, they can be uploaded as a .ZIP file.</p>
              
              <p>A section titled &ldquo;Supplementary Material&rdquo; should be included before the references list with a concise description for each supplementary material file. Supplementary materials are not modified by our production team. Authors are responsible for providing the final supplementary materials files that will be published along with the article.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Cover letter</strong></p>
              <p>A cover letter written by author is required for submission. Please state in the cover letter that &ldquo;This is an original manuscript and has not been previously published or submitted to another journal.&rdquo;</p>
              
              <p><strong>Copyright Permissions:</strong></p>
              <p>Submission of a manuscript implies that, when accepted for publication, the authors will agree to automatically transfer the copyright of the manuscript to the Journal of Cardiac Interventions. All manuscripts submitted for consideration must be original work of the author(s) and the authors must certify that the material has not been previously published in any language (except in the case of Secondary Publication that was originally written in Japanese).

              <p>Authors are kindly invited to suggest at least two possible reviewers for their manuscript.</p>
              <p>Please be aware that it is the Editor's choice to assign the manuscript to the suggested reviewers or not.</p>
              <p>Authors may also suggest unpreferred reviewers. This information will be treated as confidential by the Editor.</p>
              <p><strong>Revisions and Resubmissions</strong></p>
              <p>Please provide a copy of the revised text with changes marked in the text using either tracking changes or highlighting.</p>
              <p>In your written response to the reviewers&rsquo; comments, give the page number(s), paragraph(s), and/or line number(s) where each revision was made.</p>
              <p>Respond to each referee&rsquo;s comments, indicating precisely the changes made in response to the critiques. Also, give reasons for suggested changes that were not implemented, and identify any additional changes that were made.</p>
              <p>Revisions not received within 2 months will be administratively withdrawn. For further consideration, the manuscript must be resubmitted de novo. At the editors&rsquo; discretion, and in cases where substantial new data are required, extensions may be granted for revisions. In such cases, every effort will be made to retain the original reviewers.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Galley Proof</strong></p>
              
              <p>The purpose of the Galley Proof is to check for typesetting errors and the completeness and accuracy of the text, tables, and figures. Corrected proofs must be returned to the publisher within two to three days of receipt of the Galley Proof from the Editorial Office. The Journal will do everything possible to ensure prompt publication.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Publication Charges:</strong></p>
              
              <p>The journal is Open Access. Article Processing Charges (APCs) allow the publisher to make articles immediately available online to anyone to read and reuse upon publication.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Reprints:</strong></p>
